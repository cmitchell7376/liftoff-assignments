## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The app that i am developing is call myInventory. My app will give individual and companies a way to easily mange
their store inventory. myInventory will allow users to input all the stores that they own into the app, giving each store it's
own inventory. Each item stored in the app will have important information to view such as the items barcode number,
quantity, availability, item location, and price per unit. The user can also store supplier contact information into
the app for easy accessibility.Some of the things that users might find useful about my app is the simplicity of my app.
Users need something that is fast and easy to understand so they can continue doing their job. After presetting what
store the user is working at, the user only have to type into the search box what item they are looking for and it's
available just like that. I got the idea from my past experiences working in grocery and retail. A common problem
that each store had was manging their inventory in an easy to understanding way. One of the place's didn't have a system
relying on memory. Which lead to employees forgetting that they've had items in the back. While at the other location
they had an inventory system but it was so difficult that employees choose not to use it.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

Create stores: Users will be able to put stores that they own into the application database. Each store will have it's
own inventory.

Manage inventory: Users will be able to places orders, add items, remove items, and view receipts of past orders.

Search: Users will be able to search inventory for a particular item.

Manage User Account: Users will be able to update any info within their profile.

### Technologies
Java
Gradle
Thymeleaf
MySQL
JavaScript
SpringBoot

### What I'll Have to Learn
Some of the things that i will have to learn is Spring security for user login. As well as using some JavaScript
to make my application more interactive and using a public API to make use of a barcode scanner to put items into the
database instead of manually typing them in.
